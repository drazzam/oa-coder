# OA Coder (MCQ Solver Edition)

OA Coder is an Electron application that captures screenshots and leverages the Gemini API to analyze them. This version is specialized for solving multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from screenshots. It can identify the question, analyze options, and select the correct answer with explanations. The app supports both single screenshot processing and multi-page mode for capturing multiple images before analysis.

## Features

- **MCQ Solver:** Specialized for identifying and solving multiple-choice questions.
- **Screenshot Capture:** Use global keyboard shortcuts or UI buttons to capture the screen.
- **Gemini AI Integration:** Send captured screenshots to Google's Gemini API for automated analysis.
- **Multi-Page Mode:** Combine multiple screenshots for questions spanning several pages.
- **Click-Through Mode:** Toggle between interactive and click-through modes to interact with content underneath the app.
- **Customizable UI:** Transparent, always-on-top window with an instruction banner and specially formatted MCQ responses.
- **Global Shortcuts:** Easily control the application using keyboard shortcuts.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- A Google AI Studio API key for Gemini

## Installation

3. **Configure the application:**
   Create a config.json file in the project root with your Gemini API key and (optionally) your desired model. For example:

    {
      "apiKey": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY",
      "model": "gemini-1.5-pro"
    }

1. **Gemini API Integration:** Uses Google's Gemini API instead of OpenAI's API
2. **MCQ Specialization:** Optimized for solving multiple-choice questions rather than coding problems
3. **Click-Through Mode:** Added the ability to toggle between interactive and click-through modes to solve the scrolling/clicking issues
4. **UI Improvements:** 
   - Added on-screen buttons for easier control
   - Enhanced result display with MCQ-specific formatting
   - Fixed scrolling issues in the response overlay
5. **Better Web Page Interaction:** You can now toggle the app to be non-interactive, allowing you to scroll and click on web pages underneath
